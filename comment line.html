<h1>About Cat </h1>
<h2> CAT </h2>
</center>
<p>Cats have sharp eyes, sensitive ears, and soft fur, which makes them look cute. They love to play with balls of yarn and can sleep for many hours. Cats eat both meat and plant-based food. My favourite thing about cats is their playful jumps and gentle purring when happy.</p>
