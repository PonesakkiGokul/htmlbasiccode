<p class="para"><b>Parrots are intelligent, colourful birds belonging to the order Psittaciformes, known for their strong curved beaks, ability to mimic speech, and zygodactyl feet with two toes forward and two backward.</b> Found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, they have a diverse diet of fruits, seeds, nuts, and insects. Parrots are highly social and often live in large flocks, communicating through complex vocalizations. While many wild species thrive, some are threatened with extinction, and some are kept as pets due to their intelligence and affectionate nature. </p>

<h3>Key Characteristics : </h3>
<ul>
<p><li type="square"><h4>Curved Beak:</h4> A strong, curved beak is used for cracking nuts and peeling fruits and grains.<br></li>
<li type="square"><h4>Zygodactyl Feet:</h4> They have four toes on each foot, with two pointing forward and two pointing backward, which helps them climb and hold food.<br> </li>
<li type="square"><h4>Intelligence:</h4></li> Parrots are very intelligent, with large brains, and are capable of learning, problem-solving, and tool use.<br> 
<li type="square"><h4>Mimicry:</h4> They are known as "talking birds" because of their remarkable ability to imitate human speech and other sounds.<br></li>
<li type="square"><h4>Colourful Plumage:</h4> Parrots are often brightly coloured, though their colours and patterns vary widely between species.<br></li></p>

 <p class="para1">Elephants are <b>the world's largest living land animals, known for their massive bodies, large ears, thick pillar-like legs, and a long, prehensile trunk used for grasping, lifting, and drinking.</b> They are herbivorous mammals found in various habitats across Africa and Asia, with three recognized species: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants possess distinct characteristics such as tusks, which are elongated teeth used for defense, digging, and moving objects, and they are highly intelligent animals with strong social bonds.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
<ul>

<p><li><h4>Size:</h4></li> Elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals, with African elephants generally being larger than Asian elephants.<br>
<li><h4>Trunk:</h4></li> Their long, flexible trunk is a combination of a nose and an upper lip, used to pick up food, water, and objects, as well as to trumpet warnings.<br>
<li><h4>Tusks:</h4></li> These are modified incisor teeth that serve as tools for digging, moving objects, and for defense against predators or rivals.<br>
<li><h4>Ears:</h4></li> Large, flat ears help elephants stay cool by radiating heat from their bodies and are also used for communication.<br>
<li><h4>Legs:</h4></li> They have thick, columnar legs that support their immense weight.<br> 
<li><h4>Skin:</h4></li> Elephants have tough but sensitive grey skin.</p>

<p class="para2">Fish are cold-blooded, gill-breathing aquatic vertebrates with fins instead of limbs, found in diverse habitats from freshwater to saltwater. They serve as a major global food source, are important in aquaculture, and represent a vast diversity of over 35,000 species, including bony fish and cartilaginous fish like sharks and rays. Key characteristics include gills for breathing underwater, fins for swimming, and scales, with most being ectothermic (cold-blooded). </p>

<h3 id="red">Key Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<p><li type="circle"><h4>Aquatic Habitat:</h4> Fish live in water, which can be freshwater (lakes, rivers) or saltwater (oceans, seas). <br>
<li type="circle"><h4>Gills:</h4> They breathe underwater using gills, which extract oxygen from the water.<br>
<li type="circle"><h4>Fins:</h4> Instead of limbs, fish have fins for movement and balance, including a tail fin, paired fins, and sometimes unpaired fins.<br>
<li type="circle"><h4>Cold-Blooded (Ectothermic):</h3> Most fish are cold-blooded, meaning their internal body temperature changes with the surrounding water temperature.<br> 
<li type="circle"><h4>Scales:</h4> The majority of fish are covered in scales that protect their bodies.</p>
