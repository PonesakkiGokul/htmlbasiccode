<p>This proverb is used when someone blames the quality of their equipment or other external factors when they perform a task poorly.</p>

<p>Fools lose money because of their foolish conduct.</p>
<li>After victory, tighten your helmet chord.</li>
<p>There is no room for complacency. Get down to work after a victory. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, calls it Day 0 mentality.</p>
<li>A good listener is a silent flatterer.</li>
<p>Human beings have an innate desire to be listened, but only few are good listeners. So, if you listen to someone attentively, you‚Äôll flatter them.</p>

<ul>
<li>A cat has nine lives.</li>
<p>Cat can survive seemingly fatal events.</p>
<li> Action speaks louder than words.</li>
<p>Action is a better reflection of one‚Äôs character than words because it‚Äôs easy to say things, but difficult to act on them and follow through.</p>
<li>A diamond with a flaw is better than a common stone that is perfect.</li>
<p>A rare, precious opportunity that comes with some problems is better than a regular opportunity that seems to be perfect.</p>
</ul>

<ul type="circle">
<li>A lean agreement is better than a fat lawsuit.</li>
<p>In disputes, it‚Äôs better to compromise and get only part of the potential outcome than to contest an expensive lawsuit for years, with no guarantee on the outcome.</p>
<li>A leopard doesn‚Äôt change its spots.</li>
<p>People can‚Äôt change their innate character, especially bad.</p>
<li>All is fair in love and war.</li>
<p>One can break the rules of fair play under extenuating circumstances.</p>
</ul>

<ul type ="square">
<li>All is well that ends well.</li>
<p>As long as the outcome is good, problems on the way don‚Äôt matter.</p>
<li>All lay loads on a willing horse.</li>
<p>A person who says ‚Äòyes‚Äô, even if hesitatingly, to any work given to him will soon find himself overloaded with work.</p>
<li>All that glitters is not gold.</li>
<p>Things that look good outwardly may not be as valuable or good.</p>
