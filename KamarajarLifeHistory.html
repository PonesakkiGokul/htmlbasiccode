<h1>KAMARAJAR LIFE HISTORY</h1><hr>
</center>

<p>Kumaraswami Kamaraj (1903â€“1975) was an Indian independence activist, statesman, and former Chief Minister of Madras State, now Tamil Nadu. Revered for his integrity, simplicity, and progressive policies, he is often called "Kingmaker" for his influence in national politics during the 1960s.</p>

<h2> Early life and involvement in the freedom struggle:</h2>

<p>Birth and humble beginnings: Born on July 15, 1903, in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, Kamaraj came from a humble family. He left school at a young age to support his family, but his thirst for learning and public service was deeply influenced by the nationalist ideals of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>A staunch activist: The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 profoundly affected Kamaraj, inspiring him to join the Indian independence movement. He became a member of the Indian National Congress at age 17 and was mentored by veteran Congress leader S. Satyamurti.</p>

<p>Imprisonment for the cause: Kamaraj participated in numerous protests and movements against British rule, including the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 and the Quit India Movement in 1942. His activism led to multiple arrests, and he spent a significant amount of time in jail. </p>

<h2>Career as Chief Minister of Madras State:</h2>

<p>Kamaraj served as the Chief Minister of Madras (later Tamil Nadu) for three terms, from 1954 to 1963. His tenure is remembered for pioneering initiatives that laid the groundwork for modern Tamil Nadu.<br>

<h3>Economic and social development:</h3>

<p><h4>Irrigation projects:</h4> His administration built 13 major irrigation dams, transforming barren lands into fertile agricultural areas and supporting small farmers.<br>

<h4>Industrialization:</h4> Kamaraj also spurred industrial growth in the state with robust government support.<br>

<h4>Infrastructure:</h4> He focused on infrastructure projects and the electrification of rural villages.</p> 

<h2>Education reforms:</h2>

<p><h4>Mid-Day Meal Scheme:</h4> Kamaraj launched the groundbreaking Mid-Day Meal Scheme to provide free meals to schoolchildren, which dramatically increased school enrollment and combatted child hunger. This was later adopted nationwide.</p>

<p><h4>Universal education:</h4> He abolished the hereditary education system and introduced free and compulsory education up to the 11th standard, providing equal opportunities for all children.</p>

<p><h4>Increased access and literacy:</h4> His government opened thousands of new schools, especially in rural areas, leading to a significant rise in the state's literacy rate, from about 7% to 37%. </p>

<h2>The "Kamaraj Plan" and national politics:</h2>

<p> In 1963, Kamaraj voluntarily resigned as Chief Minister and proposed that other senior Congress leaders also step down from their ministerial posts to focus on rebuilding the party organization. Known as the "Kamaraj Plan," this initiative was aimed at revitalizing the party's principles and commitment. He was elected President of the Indian National Congress in 1964 and served until 1967. </p>

<h3>The "Kingmaker"</h3>
<h5>As Congress president, Kamaraj played a pivotal role in shaping national politics.</h5>

<p>He was instrumental in ensuring a smooth succession following the deaths of two prime ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri.</p>

<p>His support was critical in the elevation of Lal Bahadur Shastri and later Indira Gandhi to the position of Prime Minister, which earned him the title of "Kingmaker" in the 1960s.</p>

<h2>Later years and death:</h2>

<p>Kamaraj left the Congress party in 1969 following a split and founded the Indian National Congress (Organisation).</p>

<p>He passed away on October 2, 1975, on the 12th anniversary of his resignation as Chief Minister.</P>

<p>For his selfless service to the nation, he was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, in 1976. </p>
